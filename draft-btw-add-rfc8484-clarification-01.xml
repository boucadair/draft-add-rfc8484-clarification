    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document clarifies the intent of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> whether redirection is allowed (<xref
      target="clarification"></xref>), and subsequently specifies how
      redirection is performed (<xref target="resolution"></xref>).</t>

      <t>This document adheres to Section 4.3 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-bcp56bis"></xref> which discusses the need for
      protocols using HTTP to specify redirect handling to avoid
      interoperability problems.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>"A/AAAA" is used to refer to "A and/or AAAA records".</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t><xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that the support of HTTP
      redirection is one of DoH design goals (Section 1):<list style="empty">
          <t>"The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP. It
          establishes default media formatting types for requests and
          responses but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for
          selecting alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of
          serving new use cases. In addition to this media type negotiation,
          it aligns itself with HTTP features such as caching, redirection,
          proxying, authentication, and compression.</t>

          <t>The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
          existing DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
          the DNS."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates
      the following:<list style="empty">
          <t>"This specification does not extend DNS resolution privileges to
          URIs that are not recognized by the DoH client as configured
          URIs."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This looks like an internal inconsistency of <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> that is worth the clarification: is redirection
      allowed or not?</t>

      <t>Also, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>"A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
          HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
          response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> does not:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>specify under which conditions a discovered different URI can be
          used.</t>

          <t>describe how a different URI can be discovered using HTTP/2
          server push. The only available example in the mailing list archives
          clarifies that server push is an example of unsolicited responses.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />The text was updated late in the
          publication process to address this comment:
          https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/doh/f_V-tBgB-KRsLZhttx9tGt75cps/.
          The example provided in the thread (server push) is related to the
          second part of the above excerpt.</t>

          <t>clarify that unsolicited messages from a trusted DoH server
          should be excluded.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A clarification is proposed in <xref target="clarification"></xref>.
      This clarification focuses on a "different URI" that might be discovered
      while communicating with an HTTP server.</t>

      <t>Additionally, assuming that redirection is allowed, this
      specification recommends how it is achieved, specifically regarding
      inline resolution of any domain name in the redirect URI. This is
      required because redirection to a domain-based URI requires DNS
      resolution of that domain name, which creates a potential bootstrapping
      problem (e.g., If DoH server is the only configured DNS server,
      redirecting the client to a new server by presenting a name will
      fail).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="clarification" title="RFC8484 Update">
      <t>OLD:<list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
          HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
          response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>NEW<list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI that was discovered
          outside of the client's configuration when communicating with HTTP
          servers except via HTTP redirection from a configured URI (Section
          6.4 of <xref target="RFC7231"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Also, a DoH client MUST ignore an unsolicited response (such as
          through HTTP/2 server push) that appears to be a valid answer to a
          DNS query unless that response comes from a configured URI (as
          described in Section 5.3).</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="resolution" title="Resolving the Redirect Domain">
      <t>Redirection in DoH is slightly different from "regular" HTTP
      redirection, in that the DoH server may be the only configured DNS
      resolver for the client (e.g., as per Section 7.1 of <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>). In that case, and assuming the redirect URI
      uses a domain name, the client will be unable to contact the URI
      returned in the redirect response unless the DoH server provides the
      resolution information for that domain as part of the response. Even if
      a DoH client has a plaintext DNS resolver configured, using that
      resolver is considered as a minimal privacy leakage <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Servers supporting DoH redirect MUST support returning the redirect
      response body mechanism described hereafter.<list style="empty">
          <t>Note: "MUST" is used here because resolving the redirect name
          using Do53 will fail in some configurations, e.g.,
          https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver
          (network.trr.mode=3).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Concretely, the DoH server returns in the response body a DNS
      response with an 'application/dns-message' media type as specified in
      Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>, containing any A and AAAA
      records for the domain name in the redirect URI, including any
      CNAMEs.</t>

      <t>For example, if the redirect URI contains the domain name
      "redirect.example.com", and "redirect.example.com" is a CNAME pointing
      to "real.example.com", then an example response body would contain:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>A CNAME record for "redirect.example.com"</t>

          <t>Any A records for "real.example.com"</t>

          <t>Any AAAA records for "real.example.com"</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This approach is simple; no client or server support of server push
      is required, and it is also more efficient in terms of the amount of
      data transmitted.</t>

      <t>An early version of this document considered the use of server push
      to provide the client with the required A/AAAA information (<xref
      target="serverpush"></xref>). Nevertheless, such proposal has issues as
      discussed in Section 4.14 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-bcp56bis"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Server-redirect"
             title="Applicability to DoH Server Redirect">
      <t>This section specifies how DoH server redirection can be safely used
      to present a different URI to a requesting DoH client (<xref
      target="clarification"></xref>). To that aim, the DoH server uses HTTP
      redirection (Section 6.4 in <xref target="RFC7231"></xref> or <xref
      target="RFC7538"></xref>) and the mechanism discussed in <xref
      target="resolution"></xref> to inform the client about the new URI and
      location of the DoH server.</t>

      <t>The mechanism discussed in <xref target="RFC7838"></xref> MAY be
      implemented by a DoH server if the DoH service is authoritatively
      available at a separate network location. This mechanism requires the
      alternative service to present a certificate for the origin's host name.
      Nevertheless, <xref target="RFC7838"></xref> is not an option for some
      redirection scenarios (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref>).</t>

      <t>If the client does not support the response body with A/AAAA
      information (<xref target="resolution"></xref>), it will have to resolve
      the domain name in the redirected URI using Do53.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Discussion Notes:<list style="numbers">
              <t>Every GET request with a new query name will require
              redirection, which is suboptimal.</t>

              <t>Using POST would solve the issue, nevertheless POST responses
              are not widely cached as per Section 4.2.3 of <xref
              target="RFC7231"></xref>. </t>

              <t>Should we mention that "DoH clients supporting redirection
              SHOULD cache 301/308 redirect responses, obeying any
              Cache-Control headers if present"?</t>

              <t>What about relaxing <xref target="RFC7838"></xref> so that
              the alternate service present a certificate of a sub-domain of
              the Origin?</t>

              <t>At bootstrap, the DoH client sends a GET against a well-known
              URI to retrieve the list of supported URI templates. The server
              can redirect the client to an alternate server .This approach
              does not bloat the cache. </t>

    <section anchor="serverpush" title="Server Push">
      <t>The DoH specification allows the use of server push to send DNS
      responses (Section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>). The typical
      use case for server push is when the server knows that the client will
      need to make a request for a resource, and so provides the answer to
      that request via the server push mechanism. Sending answers to queries
      implies that the DoH server performs those queries itself, or retrieves
      them from its cache.</t>

      <t>In this case, the DoH server knows that the DoH client will need to
      resolve the domain returned in the redirect URI. Therefore, after
      receiving the initial request which would lead to a redirect response,
      but before returning the response, the server sends a push promise frame
      (Section 8.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7540"></xref>) request URL to
      retrieve the A/AAAA resource records for the domain in the redirect
      response (for example, if the domain has both A and AAAA records, two
      push promise frames would be sent). Any intermediate CNAME records would
      result in additional push promise frames. Promise requests cannot
      contain a request body as specified in Section 8.2.1 of <xref
      target="RFC7540"></xref>, thus they use the GET method specified in
      Sections 4.1 and 6 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>. The A/AAAA
      responses are then sent in separate streams as specified in Section
      8.2.2 of <xref target="RFC7540"></xref>. Finally, the redirect response
      itself is sent.</t>

      <t>An example of the use of server push for redirection is shown in
      <xref target="push"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The advantage of using server push to provide the DNS resolution
      information of the redirect domain is that, assuming that the DoH client
      already supports unsolicited server push messages, then this approach
      should work without any changes.</t>

      <t>Disadvantages include the possibility that DoH clients do not support
      server push.</t>
