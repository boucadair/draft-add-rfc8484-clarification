      <t>This document clarifies the intent of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> whether redirection is allowed or not (<xref
      target="clarification"></xref>), and subsequently specifies how
      redirection is performed (<xref target="resolution"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t><xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that the support of HTTP
      redirection is one of DoH design goals (Section 1):<list style="empty">
          <t>"The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP. It
          establishes default media formatting types for requests and
          responses but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for
          selecting alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of
          serving new use cases. In addition to this media type negotiation,
          it aligns itself with HTTP features such as caching, redirection,
          proxying, authentication, and compression.</t>

          <t>The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
          existing DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
          the DNS."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates
      the following:<list style="empty">
          <t>"This specification does not extend DNS resolution privileges to
          URIs that are not recognized by the DoH client as configured
          URIs."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This looks like an internal inconsistency of <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> that is worth the clarification: is redirection
      allowed or not?</t>

      <t>Also, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>"A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
          HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
          response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, the specification does not:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>specify under which conditions a discovered different URI can be
          used.</t>

          <t>describe how a different URI can be discovered using HTTP/2
          server push, especially if no DoH session is established with a
          server. The only available example in the mailing list archives
          clarifies that server push is an example of unsolicited responses.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />The text was updated late in the
          publication process to address this comment:
          https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/doh/f_V-tBgB-KRsLZhttx9tGt75cps/.
          The example provided in the thread (server push) is related to the
          second part of the above excerpt.</t>

          <t>clarify that unsolicited messages from a trusted DoH server
          should be excluded.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A clarification is proposed in <xref target="clarification"></xref>.
      This clarification focuses on a "different URI" that might be discovered
      while communicating with an HTTP server.</t>

      <t>Additionally, assuming that redirection is allowed, this
      specification recommends how it is achieved, specifically regarding
      inline resolution of any domain name in the redirect URI. This is
      required because redirection to a domain-based URI requires DNS
      resolution of that domain name, which creates a potential bootstrapping
      problem.</t>

             title="Clarification of Redirection in DoH                                          Redirection in DoH">
      <t>OLD:<list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through

          <xref target="RFC7231"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Also, a DoH client MUST ignore an unsolicited response (such as
          through HTTP/2 server push) that appears to be a valid answer to a

          described in Section 5.3).</t>

    <section anchor="resolution"
             title="Resolving the Redirect                                         Domain">
      <t>Redirection in DoH is slightly different from "regular" HTTP
      redirection, in that the DoH server may be the only configured DNS
      resolver for the client. In that case, and assuming the redirect URI
      uses a domain name, the client will be unable to contact the URI
      returned in the redirect response unless the DoH server provides the
      resolution information for that domain as part of the response. Even if
      a DoH client has a plaintext DNS resolver configured, there are security
      implications (see Section 3 of <xref target="RFC3552"></xref>) of using
      that plaintext resolver for resolution of the domain in the redirect
      URI.</t>

      <t>There are two possible approaches to resolving the redirect domain,
      which are not mutually exclusive, but may have different implications
      for clients: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Using server push to provide the client with the required A
          and/or AAAA information (<xref target="serverpush"></xref>)</t>

          <t>Returning the required A and/or AAAA information directly in the
          body of the redirect response (<xref
          target="responsebody"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Servers supporting DoH redirect MUST support the server push
      mechanism and SHOULD support returning the redirect response body
      mechanism. The reason that the server push mechanism is mandatory is
      that it is likely to work with existing HTTP clients that support server
      push, whereas the latter mechanism is likely to require more effort to
      support.</t>

      <section anchor="serverpush" title="Server Push">
        <t>The DoH specification allows the use of server push to send DNS
        responses. The typical use case for server push is when the server
        knows that the client will need to make a request for a resource, and
        so provides the answer to that request via the server push mechanism.
        Sending answers to queries implies that the DoH server performs those
        queries itself, or retrieves them from its cache.</t>

        <t>In this case, the DoH server knows that the DoH client will need to
        resolve the domain returned in the redirect URI. Therefore, after
        receiving the initial request which would lead to a redirect response,
        but before returning the response, the server MUST send a push promise
        frame (Section 8.2.1 of <xref target="RFC7540"></xref>) request URL to
        retrieve the A and/or AAAA records for the domain in the redirect
        response (for example if the domain has both A and AAAA records, two
        push promise frames would be sent). Any intermediate CNAME records
        would result in additional push promise frames. Promise requests
        cannot contain a request body as specified in Section 8.2.1 of <xref
        target="RFC7540"></xref>, thus they MUST use the GET method specified
        in Sections 4.1 and 6 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>. The A and/or
        AAAA responses would be sent in separate streams as specified in
        Section 8.2.2 of <xref target="RFC7540"></xref>. Finally the redirect
        response itself is sent.</t>

        <t>An example of the use of server push for redirection is shown
        below:</t>

            title="Redirect using Server Push">
            <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
          DoH Client                                               DoH Server
            |                                                        |

            |<===== Push Response for redirect.example.com/A ========|
            |<===== Push Response for redirect.example.com/AAAA======|
          ]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>The advantage of using server push to provide the DNS resolution
        information of the redirect domain is that, assuming that the DoH
        client already supports unsolicited server push messages, then this
        approach should work without any changes.</t>

        <t>Disadvantages include the possibility that DoH clients do not
        support server push.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="responsebody" title="Response Body">
        <t>Returning the required DNS response information in the body of the
        redirect request is another way to achieve the same goal. However, DoH
        clients using HTTP stacks to perform redirection transparently may run
        into problems, as this approach is specific to DoH and is thus not a
        generic solution.</t>

        <t>The approach is straightforward; the DoH server returns in the
        response body a DNS response with an application/dns-message media
        type as specified in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>,
        containing any A and AAAA records for the domain name in the redirect
        URI, including any CNAMEs. For example if the redirect URI contains
        the domain name "redirect.example.com", and "redirect.example.com" is
        a CNAME pointing to "real.example.com", then an example response body
        would contain: <list style="symbols">
            <t>A CNAME record for redirect.example.com</t>

            <t>Any A records for real.example.com</t>

            <t>Any AAAA records for real.example.com</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Advantages of this approach are simplicity; no client or server
        support of server push is required, and it is also more efficient in
        terms of the amount of data transmitted.</t>

        <t>The main disadvantage is that this approach requires new code to be
        developed in DoH clients to handle the new condition that a redirect
        response will contain a application/dns-message media type in the
        response body.</t>
