    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document clarifies the intent of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> whether redirection is allowed or not. </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t><xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that the support of HTTP
      redirection is one of DoH design goals (Section 1):<list style="empty">
          <t> "The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP. It
          establishes default media formatting types for requests and
          responses but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for
          selecting alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of
          serving new use cases. In addition to this media type negotiation,
          it aligns itself with HTTP features such as caching, redirection,
          proxying, authentication, and compression. </t>

          <t>The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
          existing DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
          the DNS."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates
      the following:<list style="empty">
          <t>"This specification does not extend DNS resolution privileges to
          URIs that are not recognized by the DoH client as configured
          URIs."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This seems like an internal inconsistency of <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> that is worth to be clarified: is redirection
      allowed or not?</t>

      <t>Also, Section 3 of <xref target="RFC8484"></xref> indicates that:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
          HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
          response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nevertheless, the specification does not:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>specify under which conditions a discovered different URI can be
          used. </t>

          <t>describe how a different URI can be discovered using HTTP/2
          server push, especially if no DoH session is established with a
          server. The only available example in the mailing list archives
          clarifies that server push is an example of unsolicited responses.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />The text was updated late in the
          publication process to address this comment:
          https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/doh/f_V-tBgB-KRsLZhttx9tGt75cps/.
          The example provided in the thread (server push) is related to the
          second part of the above excerpt.</t>

          <t>clarify that unsolicited messages from a trusted DoH server
          should be excluded.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A clarification is proposed in <xref target="clarification"></xref>.
      This clarification focuses on a "different URI" that might be discovered
      while communicating with an HTTP server.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="clarification" title="The Clarification">
      <t>OLD:<list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
          discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
          HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
          response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query. </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>NEW<list style="empty">
          <t>A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI that was discovered
          outside of the client's configuration when communicating with HTTP
          servers (except via HTTP redirection discussed in Section 6.4 of
          <xref target="RFC7231"></xref>). </t>

          <t>Also, a DoH client MUST ignore an unsolicited response (such as
          through HTTP/2 server push) that appears to be a valid answer to a
          DNS query unless that response comes from a configured URI (as
          described in Section 5.3).</t>
