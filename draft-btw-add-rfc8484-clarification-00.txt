1.  Introduction

   This document clarifies the intent of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484]
   whether redirection is allowed or not.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Discussion

   [RFC8484] indicates that the support of HTTP redirection is one of
   DoH design goals (Section 1):

      "The described approach is more than a tunnel over HTTP.  It
      establishes default media formatting types for requests and
      responses but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for
      selecting alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation
      of serving new use cases.  In addition to this media type
      negotiation, it aligns itself with HTTP features such as caching,
      redirection, proxying, authentication, and compression.

      The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for both
      existing DNS clients and native web applications seeking access to
      the DNS."

   Nevertheless, Section 3 of [RFC8484] indicates the following:

      "This specification does not extend DNS resolution privileges to
      URIs that are not recognized by the DoH client as configured
      URIs."

   This looks like an internal inconsistency of [RFC8484] that is worth
   the clarification: is redirection allowed or not?

   Also, Section 3 of [RFC8484] indicates that:

      "A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
      discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
      HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
      response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query."

   Nevertheless, the specification does not:

   o  specify under which conditions a discovered different URI can be
      used.

   o  describe how a different URI can be discovered using HTTP/2 server
      push, especially if no DoH session is established with a server.
      The only available example in the mailing list archives clarifies
      that server push is an example of unsolicited responses.

      The text was updated late in the publication process to address
      this comment: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/doh/f_V-tBgB-
      KRsLZhttx9tGt75cps/.  The example provided in the thread (server
      push) is related to the second part of the above excerpt.

   o  clarify that unsolicited messages from a trusted DoH server should
      be excluded.

   A clarification is proposed in Section 4.  This clarification focuses
   on a "different URI" that might be discovered while communicating
   with an HTTP server.

4.  The Clarification

   OLD:

      A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI simply because it was
      discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through
      HTTP/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited
      response that appears to be a valid answer to a DNS query.

      A DoH client MUST NOT use a different URI that was discovered
      outside of the client's configuration when communicating with HTTP
      servers (except via HTTP redirection discussed in Section 6.4 of
      [RFC7231]).

      Also, a DoH client MUST ignore an unsolicited response (such as
      through HTTP/2 server push) that appears to be a valid answer to a
      DNS query unless that response comes from a configured URI (as
      described in Section 5.3).

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in Section 9 of [RFC8484].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Christian Jacquenet for the review.
